# Overview

Rigging is a general term used for adding controls to objects, typically for the purpose of animation.

In this section we will cover the most common rigging features you can use in Blender:

- Armature:  A collection of bones with a relation between them.
- Constraints:  Allows to put limits on different aspects of the rig movement.
- Drivers:  Allows you to control multiple Bones at once from single controller.

In addition we will cover the following topics:

- Joints:  How to rig various hardware joints with Bones.
- Physics:  How to add real life parameters and constraints to the robot movement.

You can read more about rigging in the official Blender [documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/animation/introduction.html#rigging).
